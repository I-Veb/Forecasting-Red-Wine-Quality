# Forecasting-Red-Wine-Quality
In this project, I evaluated the performance of four machine learning algorithms for the task of red wine quality prediction: logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision tree classifier, and k-nearest neighbours (KNN). We found that the Decision Tree Classifier model performed the best on the test set, with an accuracy of 87.5%.
This means that the Decision Tree Classifier model is able to predict the quality of red wine based on the given features with a high degree of accuracy. This is important because it can help winemakers and
consumers to identify high-quality wines.
The other three algorithms also performed well on the test set, with accuracies of 85.6% for SVM, 85.9% for Logistic Regression, and 85.6% for KNN. However, the logistic regression model was the only algorithm to achieve an accuracy of nearly 86%.
One possible explanation for the superior performance of the logistic regression model is that it is a linear model. This means that it can learn the relationships between the input features and the target variable in a more straightforward way than the other algorithms, which are all non-linear models.
Another possible explanation is that the logistic regression model is less prone to overfitting than the other algorithms. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and is unable to generalize to new data. The logistic regression model's regularization parameter can be used to control the amount of overfitting.

Overall, the results of this project suggest that the logistic regression model is a good choice for the task of red wine quality prediction. It is able to achieve a high degree of accuracy while being relatively resistant to overfitting.In this project, I evaluated the performance of four machine learning algorithms for the task of red wine quality prediction: logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision tree classifier, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN).

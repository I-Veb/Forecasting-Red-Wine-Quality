# Forecasting-Red-Wine-Quality
In this project, I evaluated the performance of four machine learning algorithms for the task of red wine quality prediction: logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), decision tree classifier, and k-nearest neighbors (KNN). We found that the Decision Tree Classifier model performed the best on the test set, with an accuracy of 87.5%.
